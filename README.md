# Welcome programmers

This repository contains short and simple introductions / [revisions] / [cheatsheets] on many common programming languages.

A Google sheet for quick comparison: [Compare Code](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13k6YjFwCzvtUtiFH6bgzrfGbzPPlojOB5T6_P5zer5Y/edit?usp=sharing)

What it is not however, is an introduction to programming. If you wish to learn the basics, please
check the repository: Fundamentals [coming soon].  

Java will be taken as the standard and all deviations from the standard will be included in the language README files for quick comparison.
